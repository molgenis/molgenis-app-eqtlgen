<h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h2>

<h3 id="establishing-new-projects-inside-the-consortium">Establishing new projects inside the consortium</h3>

<p>If somebody from the consortium would like to initiate their own
project, one should fill in the project proposal form here and send it
to eQTLGen coordinator, together with google sheet where interested
cohorts can sign up. We then disseminate the proposal and in the
consortium and, if enough cohorts will sign up, will add the project
into the active projects. As a good practice, the proposed project
should not undermine the scientific novelity of any of the active and
planned consortium projects. If this is the case, we will encourage
collaboration and joining forces.</p>

<p>Once project is agreed, it is up to lead analyst of corresponding
project to provide analysis instructions and coordinate the analyses.</p>

<h3 id="access-to-unpublished-data">Access to unpublished data</h3>

<p>Occasionally, the results from interim unpublished freezes of the
analyses are of interest for consortium members or external
collaborators, e.g. for testing their hypotheses or developing tools.
Because we encourage collaboration and acknowledge the relevance of this
resource, we certainly encourage the use of the for collaboration inside
the consortium and, for some data modalities, also with external
collaborators.</p>

<p>Requirements for establishing collaboration:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Proposed project must not undermine the scientific novelity of any
of the active consortium projects.</li>
  <li>Unpublished summary data must not be disseminated with third parties
before it is made public by the consortium.</li>
  <li>Applicant acknowledges that data is from interim freeze and some
updates might happen in later freezes.</li>
  <li>Applicant adds “eQTLGen Consortium” as the named banner author into
the author list and adds the full banner into the supplementary
material of the paper. Individual collaborators should appear in the
PubMed under “Collaborators, Affiliations”.</li>
  <li>Applicant agrees to disseminate the submission-ready manuscript with
consortium members 2 weeks before submission and give all
collaborators the chance to give comments.</li>
  <li>Applicant agrees to disseminate any conference abstracts with
consortium members 1 week before submission and give all
collaborators the chance to give comments.</li>
</ul>

<p>For every project which makes use of non-public eQTLGen data, it is
needed to fill in the project proposal template and send it to
consortium coordinators. After inital screening, the project proposal
will be circulated in the consortium mailing list and all consortium
members have 2 work weeks to send any concerns about this collaboration.
If none are received, usually the collaboration is initiated.</p>

<h3 id="access-to-published-data">Access to published data</h3>

<p>Please find our published datasets under <a href="resources.Rmd">Resources</a> and
cite the relevant paper/preprint/resource.</p>

<h3 id="personal-data">Personal data</h3>

<p>Sensitive individual-level data is administered by individual cohorts
and each of them have their own legal requirements and procedures for
data sharing. Therefore, it is best to contact directly with
corresponding cohort PI directly.</p>
